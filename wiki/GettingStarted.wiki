#summary Start your app by following this guide.

=Getting Started= 

==Step 1 : Prerequisites==
  *   Get Latest Android SDK and ADT plugin installed from [http://developer.android.com] in your eclipse.
  *	Get the API Keys and secrets for providers you want to integrate in app. You can take help from following URLs :
   *  Twitter  - [Twitter (Show Screenshot)] 
   *  Facebook - [Facebook (Show Screenshot)] 
   * !MySpace  - [MySpace (Show Screenshot)]
   *  Linkedin - [Linkedin (Show Screenshot)]

  * 	Replace the keys and secrets in oauth_consumer.properties file with your keys and secrets.

== Step 2 : Know SDK ==

The SDK contains all the material you need to use SocialAuth Android project.
The directories are as follows:

1. libs - This contains socialauth-android.jar and socialauth-2.3.jar. You need 
to include both of these in your application. The socialauth-2.3.jar is the 
underlying OAuth infrastructure and the socialauth-android.jar has the Android 
components.

2. assets - Contains the OAuth consumer keys and secrets, that you can get
by registering your application with facebook, linkedin, twitter and myspace.
We have bundled our keys so that you can test quickly, but it is strongly
recommended that you change these keys. First, it is a security issue for
your application and secondly sometimes our keys give errors  because too 
many developers are testing.

3. src - This contains the entire socialauth-android Eclipse project if you
would like to debug or you need to make some changes. Most of the time you
should not need to.

4. examples - This contains three examples that we have built for you showing
how the SDK can be used to build a Share button, Share bar or a completely
custom UI.

5. javadoc - Documentation for SocialAuth Android

==Step 3 : Integrating SDK ==
  *	Create your project 
  * Add socialauth-android.jar and socialauth.jar in libs folder of you app. *If you are using ADT17 or more then you need to rename the lib folder in your app to libs*. Your app will add the jar to build path automatically if you are using ADT 17.

  *    Now order your jar to top as show below and click checkboxes to export and press OK.

  *    Add images from zip folder to drawables.

  *    Add oauth_consumer.properties file in assets folder of your application.



==Step 3 : Adding Permissions in Manifest File==
{{{
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"></uses-permission>
}}}

==Step 4 : Implementation==

You can use library in following three ways  :

 * By creating a Share Button that will call a dialog to show list of all providers. See share-button wiki page for implementation.
 * By creating a Share Bar containing list of all providers that can be launch on single click. See share-bar wiki page for implementation.
 * By creating Custom UI and implement providers in your own way.See custom-ui wiki page for implementation.

  
== Please Note==
